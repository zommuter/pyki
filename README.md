# pyki
A Python based, gitit inspired wiki

# Motivation
[`gitit`](http://www.gitit.net/) is great, but I miss some features and don't have time to learn
Haskell, while on the other hand I want to hack this myself...

## About the name
Python + Wiki = pyki. Short, yet apparently unused. The only apparent meaning seems to be [wiktionary.org's pyki](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pyki), which states it's a conjugation of the [Finish "pykiÃ¤"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pyki%C3%A4#Finnish), a verb meaning

> 1. To chap (of the skin, to split or flake due to cold weather or dryness).
> 1. To crack (to form cracks due to drying, shrinking or other such process).

Ok, so the project can use a crack as icon at some point...

## Components and Packages that can be used
Obviously there's no point in reinventing everything, so existing
projects will be integrated as best as possible:

* A web framework, obviously. Probably [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), though maybe [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) and a Python wrapper for it, probably [pypandoc](https://github.com/bebraw/pypandoc)
* A template system? Ideally it would work for any input format `pandoc` understands
* [git](https://git-scm.com/) and a Python wrapper, maybe [GitPython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython)
    - possibly additional support for other RCS such as DARCS, SVN, Mercurial...
* An editor with live preview would be nice. Maybe [retext](https://github.com/retext-project/retext) can be used for this, or at least serve as inspiration
